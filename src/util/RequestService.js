/**
 * Rules I am interested in:
 * 1. writing a request that has nothing to do with auth shouldn't require any knowledge or interaction with auth
 * 2. Auth issues should automatically resolve themselves somehow.
 *    For example, if you receive a token expired kind of error, the app should automatically "log you out" and require you to log in again.
 * 3. State should maybe be persisted at some level if this happens. It would not be a nice experience to get logged out and whatever form you were filling out is now blank.
 * 4. We will have to be careful about any global axios settings, because the front-end may hit other api's.
 *
 *
 * Back end notes: We will need specific errors to diferentiate between lack of permissions and lack of a valid token.
 *
 * There's a weird issue where you can upload a file and a new entry is created in the database,
 * but you still get a 500 error because the file upload failed.
 *
 * Instructions for creating a new request to the back end api:
 * 1. Run generateApiInstance to get an axios instance and assign it to a variable.
 * 2. Call that variable and pass it the url (combination of backendURL and the rest of the path, which you will find in the relevant controller file)
 * 3. And as the 2nd and 3rd arguments pass it a callback that will allow your component to respond accordingly to the response
